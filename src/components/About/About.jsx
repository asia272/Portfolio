          Hi! I'm Asia Ashraf, a passionate web developer specializing in frontend development.
          I love turning ideas into reality by creating responsive and interactive websites
           <br />
           I started my journey at the start of 2023, and I'm now diving into backend development to expand my skills and grow as a Full-Stack Developer. My goal is to become a proficient <i>Software Engineer</i>  who can tackle complex problems and build meaningful solutions.
           <br />
           Coding is my passion, and I‚Äôm always looking for opportunities to learn, improve, and contribute to meaningful projects.

           Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in gardening, especially growing beautiful flowers! üå∏
           and I also enjoy playing badminton üè∏ to stay active and energized.

           </p>
